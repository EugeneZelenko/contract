    Users can manually program @c \#ifndef statements in their code using this

    private and protected functions, or use the macros defined in
    @c boost/contract_macro.hpp (recommended only for applications where it is
    truly necessary to completely remove contract code compilation from
    production code).

    This macro is also used when contracts are not checked for private and
    protected functions, lambda functions, code blocks, loops, etc.

    include other headers from this library when contracts are not checked, but
    recommended only for applications where it is truly necessary to completely
